# Feasibility review :octicons-checklist-16:

## **What are feasibility reviews?**

Feasibility reviews are evaluations conducted to determine whether a proposal is practical and achievable within the constraints of the facility's resources and capabilities. 

Feasibility reviews are a critical step in the workflow where proposals are reviewed for their feasibility before they can proceed to further stages.

## **How do I configure the system for Feasibility review?**

Conditions: 

* Create call
* Have a workflow assigned to the call in which draft converts to feasibility review status after the event trigger submitted
* Have the call reach close
When the call deadline closes the system will be configured for feasibility review

Alternatively, as a user officer you may manually change proposal's status to **feasibility review**
