# Welcome to the User Officer guide!

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________

There are three fundamental tutorials in this guide:

![Call](../../assets/images/call.png){ width="450" align=right } 
!!! info inline end ""
    [Create a call :material-calendar-blank:](creating_call.md){ .md-button .md-button--primary }
    
    Calls allow usersâ€™ proposals to be submitted and managed within User Office. A call is a period of time during which users can submit their proposals to a specific facility for processing. 

![Workflow](../../assets/images/workflow.png){ width="450" align=right } 
!!! info inline end ""
    [Create a workflow :material-sitemap:](creating_workflow.md){ .md-button .md-button--primary }

    Proposal workflows manages how proposals are processed, with User Officers that are defining the statuses and events which guide proposals through their whole lifecycle.
    
![Templates](../../assets/images/templates.png){ width="450" align=right } 
!!! info inline end ""
    [Create templates :material-text-box-multiple:](creating_templates.md){ .md-button .md-button--primary }

    Templates are used to save and reuse predefined information across the User Office software. Calls are built using several different types of templates which can be customized for specific needs.
