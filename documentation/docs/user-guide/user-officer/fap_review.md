## What are FAP reviews?

A FAP (Facility Access Panel) review is a process where a panel of experts evaluates proposals for access to a facility. 

This review involves assessing the scientific merit, feasibility, and resource requirements of the proposals to determine their suitability for the facility.

## How do I configure the system for FAP Review?

Conditions to be met include:

* Instrument scientists complete the feasibility review (either setting the proposal status to `fDeasible` or `Not Feasible`)Â 
* The proposal is then assigned to the FAP for evaluation (in accordance with the general proposal workflow; however, this may be defined otherwise).
