??? info "What are proposal templates?" 

    **Proposal templates** are designed to capture all necessary information that users need to provide when submitting their proposals.

Users fill in their answers to these questions in the predefined fields and submit their proposals for review.

    User Officers can also utilise **question templates** and **sub-templates** to customise proposal templates to include specific questions based on the nature and requirements of the research.
