## What are Proposal ESI templates?

??? info "Proposal ESI templates" 
    **Proposal Experiment Safety Input (ESI)** are designed to collect and document safety-related information for research proposals, ensuring that all necessary safety considerations are addressed before the experiment begins. User Officers can use ESI templates to gather details about potential hazards, risk assessments, safety measures, and compliance with regulatory standards. This structured approach helps in maintaining a safe research environment and ensures that all safety protocols are thoroughly evaluated and documented. User Officers can also utilize [**question templates**](../questions.md) and [**sub-templates**](sub_template.md) to customize Proposal ESI templates. This form is available after the users' experiment has been accepted and scheduled so that users may review and confirm the safety information in case of any changes made to the experiment.

    !!! TIP ""
        **Note**: The Proposal ESI form will only become accessible for users to fill out after their proposal status has been set to 'accepted' and the experiment has been allocated a time within the scheduler.
