## What are FAP review templates?

FAP review templates :material-note-text: are designed to capture all necessary information that reviewers need to provide when submitting their FAP reviews. These templates generally include questions regarding scientific evaluation of the associated proposal. Users fill in their answers to these questions in the predefined fields and submit their reviews.

User Officers can also utilize [questions :material-comment-question:](../questions.md) and [sub-templates :material-collapse-all-outline:](../templates/sub_template.md) to customize review templates to include specific questions based on the nature and requirements of the research.

## How do I create a FAP review template?

**Step 1: Adding topics**

- From the template page, use the `Create` button.
- Enter a name and optional description for your new template.

- This will bring you to the template editor. From here you may add topics which act as the different sections within the questionnaire that users fill out.

> **_NOTE:_** It is good practice to utilize topics to split up the presentation of information for users. For example, in a FAP review template you may wish to have a topic for addressing general comments, another for scientific merit and another for the final grade, etc.

**1. Use a pre-existing question**

**2. Edit a pre-existing question**

- First add a pre-exisiting question to the template. You can them modify it by clicking on it within the template.

> **_NOTE:_** The changes you make to questions will only be updated within the current template you are creating. If you wish to make changes to the question **across all templates** click on the `edit` (question key) link at the top of the question.

Once you are satisfied with your changes, click the `Update` button to save the changes to the question within the current template.
