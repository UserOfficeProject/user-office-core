## **What are shipment declaration templates?**

??? info "Shipment declaration templates :material-truck:" 
    [**Shipment declaration templates :material-truck:**](shipment_template.md) are standardised forms used to collect and organise information about parcels being sent to a facility. These templates can be customised to guide users through the process of declaring each shipment, generating labels for package identification, and ensuring compliance with shipping protocols. Each parcel's details, including tracking information and handling instructions, are documented to facilitate smooth and traceable delivery to the facility.

    !!! TIP ""
        **Note**: The shipment declaration form will only become accessible for users to fill out after their proposal status had been set to 'accepted' and the experiment has been allocated a time within the scheduler.
