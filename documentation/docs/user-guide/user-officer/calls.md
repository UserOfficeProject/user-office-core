## **What are calls?**

??? info "Calls" 
    **Calls** :material-calendar-blank: allow usersâ€™ **proposals** :material-folder-outline: to be submitted and managed within User Office. A call is a period of time during which users can submit proposals to a facility. Calls have a start and an end date and are linked to several different kinds of [**templates :material-text-box-multiple:**](templates/templates.md) (such as [**proposal templates**](templates/proposal_template.md) which act as the questionnaire that users must fill out when creating their proposals). Calls are assigned to [**FAPs**](fap.md) (Facility Access Panels) for proposal review and evaluation. Calls are also linked to a [**proposal workflow**](proposal_workflow.md), which dictates the lifecycle of the proposals within a call. 

    * The [**templates** :material-text-box-multiple:](templates/templates.md) allow User Officers to customise calls with specific requirements regarding the type of research users may conduct. Templates also specify and collect the information that users must provide in order to facilitate their research.

    * The [**FAP (Facility Access Panel)**](fap.md) is the group responsible for evaluating users' research proposals which are assigned to proposals and calls.

    * The [**proposal workflow**](proposal_workflow.md) specifies which stages the proposals assigned to the call will go through. This is configured by defining the [**events**](proposal_workflow.md) that must occur in order for proposals to progress to the next [**status :material-folder-cog-outline:**](proposal_workflow.md).

## **How do I edit an active call?**

**Best practice for editing active calls** 

Once a call has been created it becomes `ACTIVE` meaning that it is open for users to submit their proposals. Therefore, if changes are made to active calls proposals submitted after the update may be different. This may cause disavdantage to users, therefore User Officers must take care to ensure that 

All active calls can be seen by filtering by 'Active' Status within the the Calls page. Active calls can be edited by clicking on the `EDIT` :material-pencil: action. This opens the update call pop-up. Once you have made the desired changes, click on `UPDATE` to update the call. See more information about the call sections and information on the [**'Creating a call' page**](creating_call.md)
