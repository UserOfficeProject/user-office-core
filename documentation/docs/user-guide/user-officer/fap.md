# FAPs

### **What are facility access panels?**

* Facility Access Panels (FAPs), are groups of external reviewers responsible for evaluating research proposals. These panels consist of experts who assess the feasibility, significance, and resource requirements of the proposals. Each FAP typically includes a **chair**, **reviewer** and **secretary** to oversee the review process and ensure thorough and unbiased evaluations. FAPs play a crucial role in maintaining the integrity and quality of the proposal review process by providing independent and specialised assessments

* User Officers can manage the FAPs assigned to proposals and provide general information such as labeling FAPs with a code, a description, and specifying the required number of proposal ratings. FAP templates can be utilised across multiple proposals, helping streamline the organisation and operation of the review process. This ensures that proposals are evaluated efficiently and according to standardised criteria such as the **grade guide**.
