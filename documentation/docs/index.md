## Welcome to User Office

The User Office project is an international collaboration to build flexible web software designed to efficiently run and organize user programs at various scientific facilities. 

We have built this software with flexibility in mind - allowing user officers and user program managers to configure the software to the specific needs of their facility.

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________

## Key Features

- **Proposal Submission:** Scientists can submit proposals based on questionnaires and calls defined by user officers.
- **Workflow Definition:** User officers can define workflows to describe different facility access routes.
- **Technical Reviews:** Facility science staff can submit technical reviews on each proposal.
- **Scheduler:** User officers can utilize the scheduler for efficient resource allocation, instrument management, and experiment scheduling.
- **Science Evaluation Panels:** Science evaluation panels can be set up to review proposals.
