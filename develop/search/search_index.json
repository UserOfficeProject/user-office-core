Calls  are built using several different types of templates which can be <code>edited</code> and <code>cloned</code>. Templates serve many different functions; for example, they may contain specific questions  which users answer in their proposals. The template system is useful because it saves User Officers from having to create calls from scratch every time. Furthermore, templates allows for standardisation which is essential for data collection and analysis of users' responses.</p> <p>There are several different types of templates utilised within Calls:</p> PDF templates  <p>PDF templates  enable users and User Officers to download proposals in a well-formatted and standardised PDF document for summary and sharing. User Officers can customise PDF templates by adjusting code to modify elements such as font size, colour and other formatting options.</p> <p> PDF template </p> Proposal templates  <p>Proposal templates  are designed to capture all necessary information that users need to provide when submitting their proposals. These templates generally include questions regarding experiment details, objectives, safety considerations and required resources. Users fill in their answers to these questions in the predefined fields and submit their proposals for review.</p> <p>User Officers can also utilise questions  and sub-templates  to customise proposal templates to include specific questions based on the nature and requirements of the research.</p> <p> Proposal (viewed from the user's perspective) </p> Sample declaration templates  <p>Sample declaration templates  are designed to collect detailed information about the samples that researchers intend to use in their experiments. The purpose of these templates is to standardise the way sample-related data is gathered, ensuring that all necessary details are captured uniformly across different proposals. These templates are linked to proposal templates  through sample declaration questions .</p> <p> Sample declaration question linking to a Sample Delaration Template and Sample Experiment Safety Input (ESI) template </p> Sub templates  <p>Sub templates  are used to streamline and organise the creation of complex proposal templates .. They serve as reusable building blocks containing questions , enabling User Officers to efficiently manage and deploy recurring sets of questions across multiple proposals.</p> <p>Sub templates are created by grouping related question templates into a cohesive unit and saving them as a standalone entity. When constructing or modifying a proposal template, User Officers can easily select and insert these sub templates into the appropriate sections, ensuring consistency and reducing the time required to build detailed proposal forms.</p> <p> Sub template </p> Shipment declaration templates  <p>Shipment declaration templates  are standardised forms used to collect and organise information about parcels being sent to a facility. These templates can be customised to guide users through the process of declaring each shipment, generating labels for package identification, and ensuring compliance with shipping protocols. Each parcel's details, including tracking information and handling instructions, are documented to facilitate smooth and traceable delivery to the facility.</p> <p>Note: The shipment declaration form will only become accessible for users to fill out after their proposal status had been set to 'accepted' and the experiment has been allocated a time within the scheduler.</p> <p> Shipment declaration (viewed from the user's perspective) </p> Visit registration templates  <p>Visit registration templates  are predefined forms used to gather and organise information from visitors planning to access a research facility. These templates collect essential details regarding visitor accomodation needs, arrival and departure dates, and on-site access, ensuring that the visit is properly coordinated and compliant with facility protocols.</p> <p>Note: The visit registration form will only become accessible for users to fill out after their proposal status had been set to 'accepted' and the experiment has been allocated a time within the scheduler.</p> <p> Visit reigstration (viewed from the user's perspective) </p> Proposal ESI templates  <p>Proposal Experiment Safety Input (ESI)  are designed to collect and document safety-related information for research proposals, ensuring that all necessary safety considerations are addressed before the experiment begins. User Officers can use ESI templates to gather details about potential hazards, risk assessments, safety measures, and compliance with regulatory standards. This structured approach helps in maintaining a safe research environment and ensures that all safety protocols are thoroughly evaluated and documented. User Officers can also utilise questions  and sub-templates  to customise Proposal ESI templates.

User Officers can customise workflow templates by adding, removing or modifying statuses to fit specific needs, such as including 'Technical Review' or 'FAP Review' stages.
