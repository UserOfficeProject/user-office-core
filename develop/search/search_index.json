Calls are built using several different types of templates which can be edited and cloned. Templates serve many different functions; for example, they may contain specific questions which users answer in their proposals. The template system is useful because it saves User Officers from having to create calls from scratch every time. Furthermore, templates allows for standardisation which is essential for data collection and analysis of users' responses.</p> <p>There are several different types of templates utilised within Calls:</p> PDF templates <p>PDF templates enable users and User Officers to download proposals in a well-formatted and standardised PDF document for summary and sharing. User Officers can customise PDF templates by adjusting code to modify elements such as font size, colour and other formatting options.</p> <p> PDF template </p> Proposal templates <p>Proposal templates are designed to capture all necessary information that users need to provide when submitting their proposals. These templates generally include questions regarding experiment details, objectives, safety considerations and required resources.

User Officers can use ESI templates to gather details about potential hazards, risk assessments, safety measures, and compliance with regulatory standards. This structured approach helps in maintaining a safe research environment and ensures that all safety protocols are thoroughly evaluated and documented.
