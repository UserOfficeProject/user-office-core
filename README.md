## Getting started

To be able to start both backend and frontend locally you will need to:

1. Install all needed dependencies with `npm install`
2. Start the application using `npm run dev` or `npm run start`

## Check the .env file
If .env file is not preset during startup of the project, it will be created using example.env file template
The `example.env` and `.env` files are located in `apps/backend` and `apps/frontend` accordingly.

## Running with docker-compose

If you want to get something running for testing purposes only, you can run the docker-compose file located at the root of the repository. Use the following steps:

1. docker-compose up
2. Visit localhost:33000
3. Use the default users for login, Aaron_Harris49@gmail.com (User Officer) or Javon4@hotmail.com (User) with password "Test1234!"

## Monorepo future plans

Plan on how to continue with the monorepo in the future:

1.  Start adding the shared libraries like: shared-types, validation and others that need to be shared between different apps (example here: https://github.com/martin-trajanovski/user-office-core-monorepo). It requires [craco](https://github.com/dilanx/craco) tool for building react apps that have sources outside src folder. This will cleanup the frontend app a lot because we can move all graphql files and scripts in the shared-types lib and validation will simplify things a lot if added directly as part of the monorepo libs.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>

- Open [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) to view the GraphQL playground and schema in the browser.
- Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app in the browser.

### `npm run lint`

Lints typescript code and log if there are any errors.<br>
`npm run lint:fix` should be used if you want to fix all auto-fixable errors and warnings.
